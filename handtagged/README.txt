FOLDERS

2 folders contain CHAT files, which belong to the CLAN software. The only difference from the original files is that there are %pho layers after each utterance, which is processed by using a dictionary. Originally %pho layer provides possible pronunciations of an utterance. During hand tagging process, some of the %pho lines are cleaned up by indicating the pronunciation in the utterance (done by Miranda). In case someone might need the original CHAT files that she worked on, I included them here, too. 

Due to the number of hand aligned lines being small, the processes part of the CHAT files is very sparse; i.e. 1-5 lines of a file indicates the correct pronunciations. 

FILES

These files are extracted from the CHAT files. Only processed parts of the CHAT files are extracted. Each line has an ID in the beginning. This ID is consistent with the FA output in the parent folder. In order to cross check between hand aligned data and FA data, you can use the ID's.
